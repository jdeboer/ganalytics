# GetGaData <- function(query, noSampling == FALSE) {
#   # For each segment, non-overlapping date range, and profileId...
#   #   If noSampling then
#   #     Do we expect the query will result in sampling?
#   #       If so, then split the date range
#   #   
#   #   Fetch the first page of data
#   #     If the 
#   #   If GaMaxResults(query) > kGaMaxResults then pagination is required
#   #     else 
#   #       Fetch the data
#   #     If the data is sampled, then split the date range using this formula
#   #        
#   
# #   1,000,000 maximum unique dimension combinations for any type of query. What
# #   does this mean? Suppose you request a content report for your site, which
# #   has visits to 1,000,000 unique URLs for the requested date range. In such a
# #   situation, your report would take a very long time to load in order to
# #   display all the unique URLs for that date range. To avoid this, Google
# #   Analytics retrieves a maximum of 1,000,000 unique URLs (or any other
# #   dimension value) for a given request, divided by the number of days in the
# #   request. For example: A report for the past 30 days would display
# #   approximately 30,000 unique URLs (e.g. 1,000,000/30). A report for the past
# #   60 days will display a maximum of 16,000 unique URLs (e.g. 1,000,000/60). 
# #   Because unique URLs and campaign keywords repeat across given days, this
# #   threshold is reached only by sites with lots of unique content and/or
# #   keywords.
# #   
# #   500,000 maximum sessions for special queries where the data is not already
# #   stored. In many of the reports, the list dimension is fixed, so Analytics
# #   can store this data. This enables Analytics to deliver timely reporting
# #   information for large data sets. However, if you request an ad hoc set of
# #   dimensions, that information is not stored and Analytics will need to
# #   perform the calculation at the time of the request. In this case, only
# #   500,000 sessions will be processed in order to improve the response time.
# #   Your report query might easily exceed 500,000 sessions if you request an
# #   adhoc dimension over an expanded date range. To get a sense of how many
# #   sessions might appear in your request, you can use the visits metric over
# #   the date range you intend to query. This maximum of 500,000 session applies
# #   per web property.
