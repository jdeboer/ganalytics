PerHit(object, ...)

\arguments{
\item{object}{a gaMetExpr object to coerce to user-level.}

\item{...}{Other conditions to be included in the segment definition.}

\description{
Set the scope of a gaMetExpr object to hit-level, or transforms a condition
filter to a sequence filter of length one (i.e. conditions to match a single
hit).
